# How to contribute

## Introduction

This repository contains the sources to automatically create a tutorial driven documentation for [Stopping](https://github.com/SolverStoppingJulia/Stopping.jl) project.

You can visit the latest stable version of this documentation [here](https://SolverStoppingJulia.github.io/StoppingTutorials/stable/).

Please, read this document as a starting point before a contribution.

## Automatic generation

[StoppingTutorials web page](https://SolverStoppingJulia.github.io/StoppingTutorials/stable/) is automatically generated by using [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl) package. 

Please, follow their rules and conventions to alternate comments and source code.

## Add a new tutorial

1. Add a new Julia script to `src` directory.
2. Add a new `(Title,filename)` pair to `files` array in [deps/build.jl](https://github.com/SolverStoppingJulia/StoppingTutorials/blob/master/deps/build.jl) file.

Tutorial headers will be auto generated using the specified `Title`.
